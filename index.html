                Science fiction (sometimes shortened to sci-fi) is a genre of speculative fiction, which typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and 
                technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction can trace its roots to ancient mythology.[1] It is related to fantasy, 
                horror, and superhero fiction and contains many subgenres. Its exact definition has long been disputed among authors, critics, scholars, and readers.

                Mystery is a fiction genre where the nature of an event, usually a murder or other crime, remains mysterious until the end of the story.[1] Often within a closed circle of 
                suspects, each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime. The central character is often a detective (such as 
                Sherlock Holmes), who eventually solves the mystery by logical deduction from facts presented to the reader.[2] Some mystery books are non-fiction. Mystery fiction can be 
                detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle or suspense element and its logical solution such as a whodunit. Mystery fiction can be contrasted with hardboiled 
                detective stories, which focus on action and gritty realism.

                <p id="title3">Horror</p>
                Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to frighten, or scare.[1] Horror is often divided into the sub-genres of psychological horror and supernatural horror, which is in 
                the realm of speculative fiction. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon, in 1984, defined the horror story as "a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks, or even 
                frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing".[2] Horror intends to create an eerie and frightening atmosphere for the reader. Often the central 
                menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for larger fears of a society.
